My generic grid URL: ViewBook\GenericGrid


An example form post button:

@using (Html.BeginForm("Index", "Home"))
{
    <input type="submit" value="Login2" />
}

The resulting HTML is simple enough:

<form action="/" method="post">    
  <input type="submit" value="Login2" />
</form>

Note that action is "/" because the page is "Home/Index" which is equivalent to "/", so we have in the controller:

		[HttpPost]
		[AllowAnonymous]
		public ActionResult Index(object p1)

but I have no idea what the params should be.

BTW, we should probably add back in:

[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]

and in the cshtml:

@Html.AntiForgeryToken()

Now, how does the blimey model work???
