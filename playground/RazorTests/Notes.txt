My generic grid URL: ViewBook\GenericGrid


An example form post button:

@using (Html.BeginForm("Index", "Home"))
{
    <input type="submit" value="Login2" />
}

The resulting HTML is simple enough:

<form action="/" method="post">    
  <input type="submit" value="Login2" />
</form>

Note that action is "/" because the page is "Home/Index" which is equivalent to "/", so we have in the controller:

		[HttpPost]
		[AllowAnonymous]
		public ActionResult Index(object p1)

but I have no idea what the params should be.

BTW, we should probably add back in:

[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]

and in the cshtml:

@Html.AntiForgeryToken()

Now, how does the blimey model work???

		
Session timeout:

The default session timeout does not seem to be 20 minutes as previously documented on the web.  It seems very short indeed.  To change this:

<sessionState mode="InProc" customProvider="DefaultSessionProvider" timeout="10">

where timeout is in minutes.  Still, that doesn't seem to work quite right, possibly a development issue when running the site from VS?

How to capture when the session times out?

Also, the above is a good example of logging.

Migrations:

In the Package Manager Console:

enable-migrations
add-migration InitialCreate
update-database

RazorEngine:

If you install RazorEngine, it f***s up your app.

You have to remove the reference to the "System.web.Razor" under the assembly bindings in your web.config
