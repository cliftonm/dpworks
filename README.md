Department of Public Works Management Tool

Automating Department of Public Works processes, such as work orders and project estimates, initially for the Dartmouth MA DPW.

This is a pro bono project to support "making government services simple, effective, 
and easy to use" and was initiated by a request posted on [Code For America].

The management tool is a web application implemented in ASP.NET / Razor with C#.  

If you are a municipality interested in this project or you are developer interested in working on the code base, 
please contact [Marc Clifton]. 

The website can be found at [dpworks.org], though nothing is up and running yet at the time of this writing (10/28/2014)
